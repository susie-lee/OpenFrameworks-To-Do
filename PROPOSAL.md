# Project Proposal

My final project idea is an interactive to-do list where the tasks
can be organized and ordered as the user wishes. The user will be
able to create different categories to place tags and prioritize
them by dragging them in order or designating the tasks a color.
Once the task is completed, the user can drag the task to a graphic
flower in the window to help it grow throughout a selected window of
time (one day, one week, one month). If a task in not completed for a
certain period of time, the flower will begin to wither and eventually
die.

The library I am considering to use for this is MyGUI
(http://mygui.info/). This will allow me to design how the to-do list
and flower will look. I will also be using MongoDB
(https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-cxx-driver/) for a database to preserve the
user's data and whenever they exit and reload the app.

I was inspired to do this project from what my CS 196 students are implementing
this semester. They are currently creating a mobile application through React
Native for a user to record how much water they have had in a day. If they are
not drinking enough water, the application will remind them to do so. To store
user data, they are using Firebase. I will build upon my background in the
skills used for this project for my final project in CS 126.
